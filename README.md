 BACKGROUND  
The background of the Trip Planner website project is rooted in the growing demand for convenient and 
personalized travel planning solutions. With the increasing number of people seeking easy and budget
friendly travel experiences, there is a need for platforms that simplify trip planning. This project aims to 
address this need by providing a user-friendly website where travelers can log in, set their budget preferences, 
and receive customized travel destination recommendations based on their budget.

Scope  
The scope of this project spans several critical areas in education:  
• The system will recommend destinations, budget-friendly hotels, and travel experiences based 
on user preferences such as travel type (e.g., solo, couple, family) and budget. 
• The website will calculate the estimated carbon footprint of the user’s trip based on factors 
like transportation choices and distance, promoting eco-friendly travel decisions. 
• Using Google Places API and Google Generative AI Model, the platform will provide real
time information on destinations, hotels, nearby attractions, and estimated costs. 
• The website will be built with React and TailwindCSS, ensuring a responsive, fast, and easy
to-navigate user interface, accessible across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. 

In conclusion, this Trip Planner Website aims to revolutionize travel planning by offering a 
technology-driven, user-centric, and environmentally responsible platform. By addressing common 
travel planning challenges and leveraging cutting-edge tools, the project has the potential to reshape 
the way people organize their journeys, making travel more efficient, enjoyable, and sustainable.
